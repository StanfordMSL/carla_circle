# carla_circle


workspace for ros and scripts to work with Carla Event 5


*Stage 1*:

    Each team will have a single agent only.  
    No bot cars.  
    Your agent will enter the roundabout, drive for 5 minutes, then leave. Entry/exit points are similar to the previous CARLA event.  
    Success is determined by how long you can sustain driving on the roundabout without collisions.  

*Stage 2*:

    Similar to Stage 1. However, each university is expected to instantiate and run two agents, instead of a single agent.
